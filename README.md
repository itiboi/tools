CaCalUploader (Python)
----------------------

Handy script for RWTH Aachen University: It fetches all events of your CampusOffice calendar and uploads them to a
CalDAV calendar of your choice. It loads everything from a config file and can so easily be run as cron job.

IMPORTANT: This script moved to it's [own repository](https://github.com/itiboi/cacaluploader).

gitbackup (Shell)
-----------------

Small script to backup and restore existing git repositories in one file with all unnecessary overhead stripped out.
Internally uses git bundle to backup.
